Solution Outline:

1. Minimum speed at top of loop
   For a car of mass m to "just stay on the track" at the top of a vertical loop of radius r, the normal force there goes to zero and weight supplies exactly the centripetal force:
   [
   mg = mv²/r => v_min = √(rg).
   ]
   With r=5.0 m and g ≈ 9.8 m/s², one finds
   [
   v_min = √(5.0×9.8) = 7.0 m/s.
   ]

2. Minimum launch height H
   From energy conservation (assuming no friction), the car must arrive at the top of the loop (which is 14 m above the ground in the figure) with at least 7.0 m/s. At the top, its total energy is
   [
   E_top = mg(14) + ½mv_min².
   ]
   Hence the required initial potential energy is
   [
   mgH = mg(14) + ½m(7.0)².
   ]
   Numerically,
   [
   mg(14) = 1000×9.8×14 = 137,200 J,
   ½m(7.0)² = ½×1000×49 = 24,500 J.
   ]
   So
   [
   mgH = 137,200 + 24,500 = 161,700 J
   => 1000×9.8×H = 161,700
   => H ≈ 16.5 m.
   ]

3. Compression of the emergency spring
   If the brakes fail when the car is up on the right side at height 14 m, it will roll forward and convert its gravitational potential energy mg(14) into spring potential ½kx². Thus,
   [
   mg(14) = ½kx²,
   ]
   with k=1.4×10⁴ N/m. Numerically,
   [
   mg(14) = 1000×9.8×14 = 137,200 J,
   ]
   and
   [
   137,200 = ½(1.4×10⁴)x² = 7000x²
   => x² = 137,200/7000 = 19.6
   => x ≈ 4.4 m.
   ]

Answers:

a) The minimum speed at the top of the loop so the car does not fall off is 
[
7.0 m/s.
]

b) The minimum height H above the ground to ensure the car stays on the track is 
[
16.5 m (approximately).
]

c) If the brakes fail when the car is at 14 m on the right side, it will compress the spring by about
[
4.4 m.
